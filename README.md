In this project I will create a simple website with recipes.
This project was found on The Odin Project.

The website starts as a simple project without any css. This will be applied later in de the course. At first we will start with setting up the homepage, some links to different pages with a recipe and adding some pictures.

During this project I'm learning the following:

1. Exploring git and pushing projects to GitHub
2. Create some basic pages using HTML
3. Practising HTML boilerplate
4. Practising using elements <img>,<a>, and list elements
5. Add, commit, and push changes
